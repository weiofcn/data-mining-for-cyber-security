this paper=20
      we discuss our research in developing general and systematic =
methods for=20
      intrusion detection. The key ideas are to use data mining =
techniques to=20
      discover consistent and useful patterns of system features that =
describe=20
      program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system =
features to=20
      compute (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize =
anomalies and=20
      known intrusions. Using experiments on the <EM>sendmail</EM> =
system call=20
      data and the network <EM>tcpdump</EM> data, we demonstrate that we =
can=20
      construct concise and accurate classifiers to detect anomalies. We =
provide=20
      an overview on two general data mining algorithms that we have=20
      implemented: the association rules algorithm and the frequent =
episodes=20
      algorithm. These algorithms can be used to compute the intra- and =
inter-=20
      audit record patterns, which are essential in describing program =
or user
       behavior. The discovered patterns can guide the audit data =
gathering
       process and facilitate feature selection. To meet the challenges =
of both=20
      efficient learning (mining) and real-time detection, we propose an =

      agent-based architecture for intrusion detection systems where the
       learning agents continuously compute and provide the updated =
(detection)=20
      models to the detection agents.=20
      <P>

</H1>As=20
      network-based computer systems play increasingly vital roles in =
modern=20
      society, they have become the targets of our enemies and =
criminals.=20
      Therefore, we need to find the best ways possible to protect our =
systems.=20
      <P>The security of a computer system is compromised when an =
intrusion
       takes place. An intrusion can be defined &nbsp;[<A =
href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/se=
c98/full_papers/full_papers/lee/lee_html/lee.html#Hlms_90">HLMS90</A>]=20
      as "any set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity,=20
      confidentiality or availability of a resource".  Intrusion =
prevention=20
      techniques, such as user authentication (e.g. using passwords or=20
      biometrics), avoiding programming errors, and information =
protection=20
      (e.g., encryption) have been used to protect computer systems as a =
first=20
      line of defense. Intrusion prevention alone is not sufficient =
because as
       systems become ever more complex, there are always exploitable =
weakness=20
      in the systems due to design and programming errors, or various =
"socially=20
      engineered" penetration techniques. For example, after it was =
first=20
      reported many years ago, exploitable "buffer overflow" still =
exists in=20
      some recent system software due to programming errors. The =
policies that=20
      balance convenience versus strict control of a system and =
information=20
      access also make it impossible for an operational system to be =
completely=20
      secure.=20
      <P>Intrusion detection is therefore needed as another wall to =
protect
       computer systems. The elements central to intrusion detection =
are:=20
      <EM>resources</EM> to be protected in a target system, i.e., user
       accounts, file systems, system kernels, etc; <EM>models</EM> that
       characterize the "normal" or "legitimate" behavior of these =
resources;=20
      <EM>techniques</EM> that compare the actual system activities with =
the=20
      established models, and identify those that are "abnormal" or =
"intrusive".=20
      <P>Many researchers have proposed and implemented different models =
which=20
      define different measures of system behavior, with an ad hoc =
presumption=20
      that normalcy and anomaly (or illegitimacy) will be accurately =
manifested=20
      in the chosen set of system features that are modeled and =
measured.=20
      Intrusion detection techniques can be categorized into <EM>misuse=20
      detection</EM>, which uses patterns of well-known attacks or weak =
spots of=20
      the system to identify intrusions; and <EM>anomaly detection</EM>, =
which=20
      tries to determine whether deviation from the established normal =
usage=20
      patterns can be flagged as intrusions.=20
      <P>Misuse detection systems, for example &nbsp;[<A =
href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/se=

=20
      encode and match the sequence of "signature actions" (e.g., change =
the=20
      ownership of a file) of known intrusion scenarios. The main =
shortcomings=20
      of such systems are: known intrusion patterns have to be =
hand-coded into=20
      the system; they are unable to detect any future (unknown) =
intrusions that=20
      have no matched patterns stored in the system.=20
      <P>Anomaly detection (sub)systems, such as IDES&nbsp;[<A =
href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/se=
c98/full_papers/full_papers/lee/lee_html/lee.html#Lunt_1992">LTG+92</A>],=

       establish normal usage patterns (profiles) using statistical =
measures on=20
      system features, for example, the CPU and I/O activities by a =
particular=20
      user or program. The main difficulties of these systems are: =
intuition and=20
      experience is relied upon in selecting the system features, which =
can vary=20
      greatly among different computing environments; some intrusions =
can only=20
      be detected by studying the sequential interrelation between =
events=20
      because each event alone may fit the profiles.=20
      <P>Our research aims to eliminate, as much as possible, the manual =
and
       ad-hoc elements from the process of building an intrusion =
detection
       system. We take a data-centric point of view and consider =
intrusion
       detection as a data analysis process. Anomaly detection is about =
finding=20
      the normal usage patterns from the audit data, whereas misuse =
detection is=20
      about encoding and matching the intrusion patterns using the audit =
data.=20
      The central theme of our approach is to apply data mining =
techniques to=20
      intrusion detection. Data mining generally refers to the process =
of=20
      (automatically) extracting models from large stores of =
data&nbsp;[<A =

      The recent rapid development in data mining has made available a =
wide=20
      variety of algorithms, drawn from the fields of statistics, =
pattern=20
      recognition, machine learning, and database. Several types of =
algorithms=20
      are particularly relevant to our research:=20
      <DL>
        <DT><STRONG>Classification:</STRONG>=20
        <DD>maps a data item into one of several pre-defined categories. =
These=20
        algorithms normally output "classifiers", for example, in the =
form of=20
        decision trees or rules. An ideal application in intrusion =
detection=20
        will be to gather sufficient "normal" and "abnormal" audit data =
for a=20
        user or a program, then apply a classification algorithm to =
learn a=20
        classifier that will determine (future) audit data as belonging =

      the percentage of the mismatched sequences (out of the total =

      we can see that in general, intrusion traces generate much larger=20

Comparing=20
      experiments that used the same sequence length, we observe that =
such a gap=20
      in A, 3.4, is larger than the gap in C, 0.9; and 1.9 in B is =
larger than

      <P>We propose a system architecture, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A =

      that includes two kinds of intelligent agents: the learning agents =
and the=20
      detection agents. A learning agent, which may reside in a server =
machine=20
      for its computing power, is responsible for computing and =
maintaining the=20
      rule sets for programs and users. It produces both the base =
detection=20
      models and the meta detection models. The task of a learning =
agent, to=20
      compute accurate models from very large amount of audit data, is =
an=20
      example of the "scale-up" problem in machine learning. We expect =
that our
       research in agent-based meta-learning systems&nbsp;[<A =

c98/full_papers/full_papers/lee/lee_html/lee.html#Stolfo_1997a">SPT+97</A=
>]=20
      will contribute significantly to the implementation of the =
learning
       agents. Briefly, we are studying how to partition and dispatch =
data to a=20
      host of machines to compute classifiers in parallel, and re-import =
the=20
      remotely learned classifiers and combine an accurate (final)
       meta-classifier, a hierarchy of classifiers&nbsp;[<A =
href=3D"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/se=
c98/full_papers/full_papers/lee/lee_html/lee.html#Chan_1993">CS93</A>].=20
      <P>A detection agent is generic and extensible. It is equipped =
with a
       (learned and periodically updated) rule set (i.e., a classifier) =
from the=20
      remote learning agent. Its detection engine "executes" the =
classifier on=20
      the input audit data, and outputs evidence of intrusions. The main =

      difference between a base detection agent and the meta detection =
agent is:=20
      the former uses preprocessed audit data as input while the later =
uses the=20
      evidence from all the base detection agents. The base detection =
agents and=20
      the meta detection agent need not be running on the same host. For =

      example, in a network environment, a meta agent can combine =
reports from=20
      (base) detection agents running on each host, and make the final =
assertion=20
      on the state of the network.=20
      <P>The main advantages of such a system architecture are:=20
      <UL>
        <LI> It is easy to construct an intrusion detection system as a
         compositional hierarchy of generic detection agents.=20
        <LI> The detection agents are lightweight since they can =
function
         independently from the heavyweight learning agents, in time and =
locale,=20
        so long as it is already equipped with the rule sets.=20
        <LI> A detection agent can report new instances of intrusions by
         transmitting the audit records to the learning agent, which can =
in turn=20
        compute an updated classifier to detect such intrusions, and =
dispatch=20
        them to all detection agents. Interestingly, the capability to =
derive=20
        and disseminate anti-virus codes faster than the virus can =
spread is=20
        also considered a key requirement for anti-virus =
systems&nbsp;[<A =

Future Work</A>=20
      </H1><A name=3D"conclusion">&nbsp;</A>In this paper we proposed a =
systemic=20
      framework that employs data mining techniques for intrusion =
detection.=20
      This framework consists of classification, association rules, and=20
      frequence episodes programs, that can be used to (automatically) =
construct=20
      detection models. The experiments on <EM>sendmail</EM> system call =
data=20
      and network <EM>tcpdump</EM> data demonstrated the effectiveness =
of=20
      classification models in detecting anomalies. The accuracy of the=20
      detection models depends on sufficient training data and the right =
feature=20
      set. We suggested that the association rules and frequent episodes =

      algorithms can be used to compute the consistent patterns from =
audit data.=20
      These frequent patterns form an abstract summary of an audit =
trail, and
       therefore can be used to: guide the audit data gathering process; =
provide=20
      help for feature selection; and discover patterns of intrusions.=20
      Preliminary experiments of using these algorithms on the =
<EM>tcpdump</EM>=20
      data showed promising results.=20
      <P>We are in the initial stages of our research, much remains to =
be done
       including the following tasks:=20
      <UL>
        <LI> Implement a support environment for system builders to =
iteratively=20
        drive the integrated process of pattern discovering, system =
feature=20
        selection, and construction and evaluation of detection models;=20
        <LI> Investigate the methods and benefits of combining multiple =
simple=20
        detection models. We need to use multiple audit data streams for
         experiments;=20
